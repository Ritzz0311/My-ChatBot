## üöÄ How to Use: Setup and Running the Chatbot

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal (CMD, PowerShell, etc.) and clone this repository:
```sh
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Project Environment

1.  **Create the Folder Structure** (if it doesn't exist)
    Your HTML file should be inside a folder named `templates`.
    ```sh
    mkdir templates
    # Now, move your HTML file into the 'templates' folder.
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Add Your API Keys**
    Open the `app.py` file and find the placeholders for the API keys. Paste your keys directly into the file.
    > **Note**: This method is for development only. For production, it's better to use environment variables.
    ```python
    # Inside app.py
    GUARDIAN_API_KEY = "your_guardian_api_key_here"
    OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY = "your_openweathermap_api_key_here"
    ```

### Step 3: Run the Chatbot

1.  **Start the Flask Server**
    Run the `app.py` file from your terminal. This will start the backend server.
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
    You should see output indicating that the Flask server is running, usually on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2.  **Open the Chatbot in Your Browser**
    Open your favorite web browser and navigate to the following address:
    ```
    [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
    ```
    The Flask server will automatically load your `index.html` page. You do not need to open the HTML file manually.

### Step 4: Use Commands to Access the Bot

Now that the chatbot is loaded in your browser, you can start interacting with it. Type your messages into the input field and press Enter.

#### User Examples:

Try some of these commands to see the bot in action:

-   `"Hello"`
-   `"How are you?"`
-   `"What is the weather in Tokyo?"`
-   `"Tell me some news"`
-   `"Can you tell me a joke?"`
-   `"What time is it?"`
-   `"Bye"`
